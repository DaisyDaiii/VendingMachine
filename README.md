* Gradle    6.7
* Jenkins   2.264
* JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA
* GitHub & Git

### Development Rules

#### To start
**Never modify code in master branch directly!** Everytime you want to do development, you need to create a new branch with a *CamelCase* name clearly describe the function of the branch. Do your development in this new branch and open a pull request only after testing your code properly. While doing development, you need to create and manage corresponding project records in the *Projects pane*.
#### Code style
1. Writing code in *IntelliJ IDEA*, make sure **NO** error ‚ùå or warning ‚ö†Ô∏è is reported before trying to push your code.
2. Use annotation to write appropriate comment for each class and method. The comment should include:  
    * Description
    * `@param`
    * `@return`
#### Post issue on GitHub
There are several templates prepared, make sure you follow the template and write each section clearly.  
To post an issue, please follow:
1. Chose a template and answer each questions clearly.
2. The issue title should describe the main idea of the issue.
3. Make sure you choose correct **issue labels**.

### Test
We use *Gradle* to automatically run JUnit testcases.  
`gradle clean build test`
